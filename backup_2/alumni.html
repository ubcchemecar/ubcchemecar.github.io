          <h2> Alex Nguyen, BASc. '10 recounts his time as the 2008-2009 UBC Chem-E-Car captain </h2>
          <p>
            Our team started out in 2008-2009 due to the AIChE student conference being set at UBC at the time. Chief Hui, the president of the chemical engineering student body at the time asked me to help him create a team to compete as we wanted to showcase our student engineers to the other schools, especially because it was on our own campus. We've had previous teams before that never stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UBC team used two power sources to power the vehicle: a 5 cell hydrogen-air fuel cell and a 5 cell zinc-air battery in parallel. The reason for connecting the power sources in parallel is to get rid of the time delay caused by producing hydrogen from a zinc and HCl reaction for the fuel cell. The car initially runs on the battery until hydrogen reaches the fuel cell where it then kicks in. The reaction car won 2nd place in the poster competition portion for safety considerations and uniqueness of idea in our first try at the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next competition we entered was in the August of 2009 at the 8th World Congress of Chemical Engineering held in Montreal, which was separate from the AIChE competition, but used the same rules with teams from around the world competing. From seeing these competitions we had different concepts we wanted to expand on, such as using pressure vessels versus using fuel cells. Our biggest change in the 2009-2010 season was added another team to the group to work on separate ideas. The idea behind this would be that out of the 2 groups it would foster competition to push each other to do better as well as allow UBC the best opportunity to develop 2 different ideas and determine which method was the best to move forward with. The other team was put together with the help of Paul Kim and support from the CHBE president at the time, Ole Bjornstad.
          </p>
 
          <p>Throughout our time with the team, we set up funding within CHBE and outside of CHBE, received help from numerous professors and hopefully made sure the team keeps going.</p>

          <h2> Luis Ledesma, BEd. 13/14 shares his Chem-E-Car story.</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> The captain of our team during our two years was Alex (3rd year and 4th year). While the entire process presented challenges along the way, the biggest challenges we faced were during the testing of the car as we had to run countless trials (sometimes well into the night) since the car frequently presented problems which deviated from our plan. It was one thing to know the chemistry and mechanism behind how the car should work and what you expect to happen, but putting it into practice in the real world was an entirely different thing (as I am sure you know a lot about). However, that is where the real magic happened, every challenge along the way was a learning opportunity that allowed us to bridge the gap from theory to practice.
          </p>

          <p>
          Apart from the labs in the CHBE program, rarely was there an opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to something concrete, which is the most valuable aspect of participating in design teams. I recommend any engineering student to find a way to participate in these types of projects as not only does it have the benefits of being a great addition to resumes and a valuable talking piece in interviews, but it helps strengthen/enhance the concepts learned in courses and build multidisciplinary skills. It is the type of project all engineering students should experience and the department would benefit from infusing it into their program rather than it being extra-curricular. Students learn best when they are able to apply and guide their own learning; while this occurred prominently during the 4th year design projects and PBL, the same type of experiential, inquiry-based learning could be applied from 1st year onwards.
