                       <p>We represent UBC in the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Chem-E-Car competition where we compete with other North American teams. We design, build and test a shoe-box sized car from scratch every year. The process involves building a power system (batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors etc), selecting a stopping mechanism reaction, designing the circuitry, coding microcontrollers and assembling the mechanical components and car body.</p>

                   <h2>The Challenges</h2>
                   <p>The competition involves making a shoe-box sized car below $2000 that travels a certain distance with a given cargo in under 2 minutes. To complicate the otherwise trivial task, the car’s stopping mechanism must be chemical – no physical or electronic clocks can be used for stopping. We are only given the cargo and travel distance 1 hour ahead of the competition. Extensive knowledge of the chemistry involved and detailed calibration curves are essential for accurate control of the car.</p>

              <h2>Team History</h2>
              <p>The UBC Chem-E-Car team started out in 2008/2009 in conjuction with the AIChE student conference held in UBC that year. Several students, with the help of CHBE faculty members, formed a team to participate in the conference's Chem-E-Car competition. The team used two power sources in parallel for the vehicle: a 5-cell hydrogen-air fuel cell and a 5-cell zinc-air battery. Their entry won 2nd place in the poster competition for safety considerations and uniqueness of idea, as it was UBC's first time participating in the competition. </p>   

              <p>In 2009/2010, the team participated in the 8th World Congress of Chemical Engineering which took place in Montreal. The team shifted the car's power source from fuel cells to pressure vessels. A second group was later added to the team; these two groups were formed to create and develop two different ideas. The better idea would then be chosen and used for the competition.</p>

              <p>In 2013, the team entered the AIChE Chem-E-Car competition with its “Dehydrated Water Mobile”. The students used a reaction of sodium borohydride and water to produce hydrogen, which powered the vehicle through a fuel cell. The team's entry was awarded 2nd place at the Pacific Northwest Regional Conference and placed 6th at the National competition. </p>

              <p>In 2014, zinc-air batteries were used as fuel cells to power the vehicle along with a sodium thiosulphate clock stopping mechanism. The 2014 vehicle, “Plastic Metals”, won the AIChE Regional competition. Competing against 35 other teams from USA, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Poland, South Korea and Malaysia, the team placed 8th out of 36 teams in the National Competition. In 2013 and 2014, UBC Chem-E-Car was the only Canadian team to qualify for the AIChE National Chem-E-Car Competition. </p>

              <p>In 2015, the team stepped up recruitment efforts and expanded the team to almost 40 members. With a significantly larger team in placed, the team was able to work on several side projects, including the International BC in LNG Conference where they walked away with 2nd place in the Innovation Engineering Challenge poster presentation. In April 2016, the team won 2nd Place in the Regionals held at the University of Washington and 1st Place for the poster presentation category.</p>

              <p>The team has been heavily involved in outreach events to share our experiences with high school students and increase their interest in STEM-related fields. The students are usually shown chemical reactions that take place in the car, such as the stopping mechanism or electrochemistry principles. In the 2015-2016 year, the team participated in more than 12 outreach events including EG-Fest at the Vancouver Public Library, UBC APSC Open House and a Geering Up! presentation.</p>

              <p>Since its establishment, the team has helped enhance the education experience of UBC students. Our team members develop a multidisciplinary skillset through working on different aspects and projects such as the mechanical aspects of putting together the car's drive train and the chemical aspects of designing and testing batteries. More importantly, our team members are given the opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to real-world projects and learn to work together in a team setting towards a common goal. </p>

              <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
              <p>UBC Chem-E-Car provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to gain relevant engineering and project management experience. Our past successes are the result of every member contributing their unique skill sets to the project and working together as a team.</p>

              <p>Building the best Chem-E-Car requires the enthusiasm and persistence of our team members. It also requires, among others, sophisticated electrochemistry equipment, lab-grade chemicals and many electronic and mechanical components. The support of the UBC community and our sponsors is essential for propelling the team to greater heights.</p>

              <p>We want everyone on the team to reach their full potential. To do so, we need your help. </p>

              <p>Our sponsors are recognized for their contributions in many ways. Aside from displaying your company logo in our events and providing advertorial space on our blog and website, we create networking opportunities for you to engage with some of the best students in UBC. Becoming a sponsor allows you to mentor and foster meaningful relationships with UBC's most diligent students and scout out future assets for your organization.</p>
