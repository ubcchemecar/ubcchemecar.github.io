&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s brewing, figuratively, not literally. The lab is not food safe, NO FOOD OR DRINKS IN THE LAB!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have read in part one, our team is working on an app to automate the brewing of craft beer. To understand the homebrewing process we made a batch of Pacific ESB, an ale that is light with a crisp bitter aftertaste. We made a few mistakes throughout the process (&lt;strong&gt;BURNT GRAINS&lt;/strong&gt;) but learned from those mistakes to make the second batch better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do next is prepare our sensors and electronics. Primarily, the qualities we are looking for are &lt;strong&gt;alcohol content&lt;/strong&gt;, acidity, and temperature. We want to ensure that the data we collect is reliable and accurate for our app and future users so we took the time to work with them and learn them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sensors-and-devices&#34;&gt;Sensors and Devices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is the DS18b20 temperture sensor from Adafruit. This is a 1-wire temperature sensor that is simple and easy too setup. It requires no external components, can be powered by logic level (5V) and like each and everyone of us, it has unique 64 bit serial code stored into its ROM memory. What this means is that we can connect up to 63 device to 1 arduino port. With this configuration protocol we will be hooking up 4 of these sensors to the arduino to measure ambient temperature, the temperature of our cooling device, and the temperature of the brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/tempsen.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Temperature sensor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s temperature sensor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we want to measure alcohol content, homebrewers measure the specific gravity of the batch. Since alcohol is less dense than water the specific gravity measurement will be lower after the fermentation process. Our goal will to measure the change in weight of a suspended mass inside the batch. To do so we want a device that measure force applied i.e weight. This is our load cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/loadcell.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Load cell&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sparkfun load cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last device in this set is a Thermoelectric cooler, otherwise known as the Peltier plate. A temperature difference between two different metals will create a voltage difference and the converse is true as well. That means, by pumping electricity, we can reach teamperatures as low as -5C and 60C at once. For us this means a system that can heat and cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/peltier.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Peltier plate&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peltier Plate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing&#34;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to make sure all of our equipment was working and seeing if anything needed calibration. Then we wanted to create a test situation where we would use the peltier plate to cool water while wew measured the temperature and weight of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first drawbacks is that the Load cell did not work. Data was not being sent and the values we had were ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/test1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Load Cell Wiring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature sensors went much better.  The design of the sensor was plug &amp;amp; play and we were getting data fast and accurately in minutes. Chaining them in series took some time. We had to get to know each and everyone of them and their adresses but it worked and worked without a hitch it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/test2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two temperature sensors here measure ambient temperature and water temperature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you have a pelteir plate one side heats up and the other side cools. So one issue is that the heat from the hot side will seep into the cold side thus losing efficiency. To rectify that we added a heatsinkand a fan to the hot side so the heat dissapates faster. On the other side we had it hooked up to a small container of water in which we ran through a pump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/peltierconfig.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The system here shows the heatsink, fan and peltier and water unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the full setup that we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/fullsetup.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete configuration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run water through a small tank that gets cooled by the peliter plate. Simple! Well it rarely is.  The water wasn&amp;rsquo;t cooling. With numerous factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our peltier plate wasnt heating at it maximum potential. The power supply we used is only rated for maximum of 3 amps. This only lowered our temperature on the cold side of the pletier plate to about 10Â°C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer2/voltage.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our preliminary test we simply put the heatsink on top of the peltier plate and the plate to the water tank. This configuration does not transfer heat well at all due to the uneven surfaces.
Lastly, The water cooling tank was too small for a flowrate that was too fast. The water didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to actually get cold before moving out of the tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the goal of testing or sensors was done. We are going to need a new laod cell or figure out whats wrong with this one. The temperature sensors work well. We just need to figure out some more design parameters before we make the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;prologue&#34;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casually during our regular weekday meeting, Siang and Thanos discussed the idea of having two teams from Chem E Car present posters at the annual Generate conference hosted by Clean Energy BC. We decided to be that second team. With less than a month away, we had to choose a topic, become experts in that topic and design a poster in hopes of winning the competition and $500 prize money. What started off as a one-time project has turned into a team interest and has some of our members looking to pursue it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the fastest growing plants, algae uses sunlight more effectively than any other plant resulting in it having up to 2x higher energy production compared to other crops. With a composition of 50% oil by dry weight, algae is the ideal crop to use for biofuel. After significant technological advancements in growing algae, oil extraction, and biofuel conversion, the overall cost can potentially be reduced to USD $1.94 per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/biofuels/biofuels.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/biofuels/biofuels.pdf&#34;&gt;Our beautiful biofuels poster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;growth-of-algae&#34;&gt;Growth of Algae&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When compared to other oil producing crops, algae can produce up to 10 times more oil per hectare of land. Algae can also grow in a wide variety of environments, including saltwater, freshwater, glaciers, and even wastewater. Since algae grows in water, algae can be grown on non arable land. Algae uses sunlight and CO2 to grow, which means that CO2 emissions from power plants and factories that are normally sequestered into the ground can be redirected to grow algae, and make the biofuel a carbon sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;production-methods&#34;&gt;Production methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main methods of growing algae, open systems and closed systems. Open systems have low control over the process, low productivity, low operation costs, and high contamination risk when compared to closed systems. This contrast causes a large argument over which method is superior. At the moment, open systems are more favourable since they are much cheaper. We believe that when the technology improves, closed systems will be the future of algae farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-of-algae&#34;&gt;Future of Algae&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lack of affordable technology, algae biofuels are currently a very expensive alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Despite this, from a research perspective, algae biofuels have the highest potential to replace these traditional fossil fuels. A lot of work needs to be done before algae becomes the leader of energy production for the transportation industry. The sheer magnitude of algae that can be produced from a small plot of non-arable land makes it the only viable option that can replace Big Oil and save our world from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Student AIChE/CACHE National Mobile Device APP Competition around the corner, our team has been working hard in exploring different ideas to showcase our creativity in a practical design. As part of our lab course field trips, many of us have visited local breweries to gain a general overview of how the general brewing process works. Keeping this in mind, we decided to try something that none of us have done before: creating an app to automate the brewing of craft beer. To create this app, we first had to be confident in carrying out the brewing process itself. Thus, we are proud to present the CHBE Brewing team, a sub-division of the Chem-E-Car team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer/logo.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Logo design courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amandapenuta.com/&#34;&gt;Amanda Penuta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;literature-review&#34;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began with browsing the web on what kind of equipment would be required to begin brewing. Without any prior experience in brewing, it was difficult to know whether we really &lt;strong&gt;needed&lt;/strong&gt; that $300 &amp;ldquo;All-in-One Reactor&amp;rdquo;. Instead, we chose to drop by some local homebrewing businesses to learn more about the process. We ended up going to Centennial Homebrewing Supplies and speaking with the owner, Brian Janzen. Brian was extremely informative, guiding us through the steps of homebrewing; from choosing the right equipment for beginner brewing, to bottling the brew at the very end. His tutorial can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdreV_tN1Y/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-brewing-process&#34;&gt;The Brewing Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer/flowchart.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Overview of the extract brewing process that we followed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanitizing&#34;&gt;Sanitizing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with this new knowledge, we purchased the equipment and got to work. We began with sanitizing all the equipment with Sani-brew (1 tbsp. powder/L of water) cleaning solution. This is to ensure that chance of bacterial growth or contamination is minimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mashing&#34;&gt;Mashing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to &amp;ldquo;mash the grains&amp;rdquo;. Contrary to what we initially thought, it had nothing to do with physically mashing the grains. This step involved adding 1L of water for each lb of grain that we had (2.5L of water in our case) to a pot and bringing the temperature up to ~145 to 155Â°F (~63 to 68Â°C). This mixture was then allowed to steep for about 60 minutes. Due to the uneven heating from the stove we were using, the grains ended up being slightly burnt&amp;hellip; but that just adds more flavor to the brew, right? (To be confirmed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sparging&#34;&gt;Sparging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the grains were steeping, another pot of water was heated up to about 175Â°F (~79Â°C). This pot of water was used in the sparging (rinsing) step. This was done by pouring the steeped grains mixture into a colander, and the additional water through the grains into another pot. The liquid that drains through is the base of our wort, while the spent grains were disposed of. The liquid malt extract was added to the wort base and stirred well until the mixture was uniform. This was done before the stove was turned on to prevent the mixture from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pot. The mixture was then brought to a boil. During this boiling time, the primary fermenter was sanitized using the Sani-brew cleaning solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;boiling&#34;&gt;Boiling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the wort was boiling, we set a timer for 60 minutes of boiling. Throughout this timeframe, hops were added at different times. For example, the Pacific ESB we were making required the 3 bags of hops to be added in at 0 minutes (beginning of boil), 45 minutes, and 55 minutes of boiling time. Once the boiling time was complete, the wort was then plunged into an ice bath to cool it down. As Vancouver has been experiencing heavy snowfall (by our standards), our ice bath consisted of snow and ice taken from right outside our doorstep. Once the wort reached a temperature of around ~69 to 73Â°F (~20.5 to 23Â°C), it was poured into the primary fermenter. The primary fermenter was topped off with water so the total volume of the brew was about 23L, with the temperature being around 21Â°C for optimal yeast pitching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fermenting&#34;&gt;Fermenting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the yeast was added to the wort, a test was conducted using a hydrometer. This showed the starting gravity of the wort, with the potential final alcohol content (around 6.5% for our brew). The yeast was added to the wort and the primary fermenter was sealed with an airlock (this allows carbon dioxide to escape during fermentation, but nothing to go into the brew). The primary fermenter was then left to sit for about a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conditioning&#34;&gt;Conditioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week of fermentation, the brew was transported into the carboy for conditioning and additional fermentation. The brew was siphoned out using a tube with a filter attached to the end to prevent larger solids from going through. Once all the brew was transported to the carboy, it was sealed with another airlock and left to sit for another week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a total of two weeks of fermentation, the brew was about ready to bottle. Another test was done with the hydrometer (pictured below) to see if the fermentation was near completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer/hydrometer.jpg&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was recommended that the reading on the hydrometer to be around 1008 to 1010, which indicates that fermentation was near completion. Our reading was roughly 1014, so pretty close.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bottling-and-carbonation&#34;&gt;Bottling and Carbonation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the brew was basically flat (not a lot of carbonation). The next step involved adding &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cup of dextrose (priming sugar) into the brew before bottling. Since the bottles are left capped for two more weeks, the priming sugar causes carbonation to occur. The brew was siphoned into two types of bottles that we purchased: 1L EZ-cap bottles and 330mL bottles with crown caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer/capper.jpg&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capping is hard work. (No, it&amp;rsquo;s not)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/beer/bottles.jpg&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bottled and ready to drink! (In two weeks)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we just need to wait about one more week from this time of posting for the carbonation to finalize. Hopefully we will have great tasting beer to drink!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Importance of Trial and Error</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone to the first of (hopefully) many blog posts for the UBC Chem-E-Car Team. The purpose of these posts is to give you, the reader insight into how our organization is run. Through this we hope to generate interest in our organization and to help get other students involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of our first post is on the importance of trial and error. Most people will look at a finished product and comment on how sleek or amazing it is; while conveniently ignoring that it took years of tinkering and modifications for that item to even function properly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First letâs take a look at the first electronic circuit that I ever made for Chem-E-Car:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/trial-and-error/first.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;First&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire device is a mess! There are wires everywhere, tons of unused board real estate, and parts that have to be tied together to fit on the board. Likewise, unsecured parts have a very unreliable connection and break off easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the summer I made a new model with the focus of eliminating loose wires and better utilizing space, this is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/trial-and-error/second.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Second&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model utilizes a lot less space, is easy to stack, and most of the components are stabilized on the board itself. However, during assembly I needed a lot of extra parts since directly soldering them often destroyed the part if not done properly. Another issue is that the model needed 4 stacks (making it really tall), and the lights and switches were not necessary. Now letâs look at the second iteration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/trial-and-error/third.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Third&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board is even MORE compact, features detachable modules for easy replacement, and utilizes an SD card and opto-gate for recording data. However, the connectors were unreliable, the copper on the board was unprotected and prone to damage which destroyed the circuit at times, and data could not be read in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix these issues I developed a 4th and final board:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/trial-and-error/fourth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fourth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system uses reliable connectors that can only be inserted in one direction, is completely modular (easy to replace destroyed parts), has a silkscreen layer that protects the circuit, only uses one layer, and utilizes a bluetooth system for real time data collection on a mobile phone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an image of all the circuits for an overall comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/trial-and-error/comparison.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Comparison&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reflections&#34;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These circuits are 1.5 years of continuous design and iteration, with each model having its flaws analyzed and corrected. They were made by an entry level chemical engineering student with NO prior experience or knowledge of electronics. The moral of the story? Good design is all about making something, figuring out what works and doesnât work then rebuilding it until it sort of works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.ubcchemecar.com/img/blog/trial-and-error/quote.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Quote&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to any beginner in terms of design, donât despair! Rather look at what you can learn from your prototype and how it can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense it is important to seek the feedback of experienced individuals. Their experience (in how NOT to do things wrong by doing it wrong) is invaluable for any would-be inventor. Look at how others have done things and learn accordingly from it. Finally remember, every master in a subject started from knowing nothing; the difference between them and the amateurs is that they never stopped trying to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
